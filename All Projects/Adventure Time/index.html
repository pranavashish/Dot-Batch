        <p class="text">
          The word ‘Adventure’ in itself is a relative concept. What might seem
          extremely adventurous to my timid self may be routine for someone
          else. The definition varies from person to person. Overall, it may be
          termed as a risky enterprise, a challenge that pushes us beyond our
          comfort zone and lands us into an uncertain zone. Fundamentally a
          sportsperson loves adventurous sport but other people also go for
          them.
          <br />
          <br />
          It is thrilling, it is exciting and it is daring. It is a repertoire
          of activities which add a new dimension to our lives and jolt us out
          of our complacence to potentially dare something which gives us a
          major adrenalin rush. For some, it must be a once in a blue moon break
          from monotony of life, for others it may be the way of itself.

          Cycling is the best way to get in shape, enjoy the outdoors, and have
          fun while you’re doing it. Unfortunately, many people think bicycles
          are for kids and often overlook the positive physical and
          psychological health benefits of cycling.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you ride bike for thirty minutes every day, you would burn eleven
          pounds of fat in a year, build lean muscle, boost your metabolism, and
          dramatically decrease your chances of acquiring heart disease. The
          immediate physical results of cycling will boost your self-esteem

          <h2 class="desc">Paragliding</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of
          flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider
          aircraft with no rigid primary structure. The pilot sits in a harness
          or lies supine in a cocoon-like 'speed bag' suspended below a fabric
          wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure
          of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic
          forces of the air flowing over the outside.
          <br />
          <br />
          Despite not using an engine, paraglider flights can last many hours
          and cover many hundreds of kilometres, though flights of one to two
          hours and covering some tens of kilometres are more the norm. By
          skillful exploitation of sources of lift, the pilot may gain height,
          often climbing to altitudes of a few thousand metres.

          <h2 class="desc">Surfing</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">
          Surfing has been a sport enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of people
          around the world. It originated in Polynesian culture as a religious
          ceremony mainly practiced by the royalty. Having been introduced from
          the Hawaiian Islands roughly 60 years ago, it has become a common
          practice in virtually every coastal beach break throughout the USA and
          numerous places around the globe.
          <br />
          <br />
          When one goes surfing there are three basic stages that are repeated
          in a surf session: getting out to the line up, waiting for the wave,
          and catching a wave and riding it in.
